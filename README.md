# EquipmentPricePrediction_Regression
Sample Regression workflow for heavy equipment price prediction


This notebook performs regression analysis to predict heavy-equipment machine prices. The data is taken from the Blue Book for Bulldozers Kaggle Competition: "The goal of the contest is to predict the sale price of a particular piece of heavy equiment at auction based on it's usage, equipment type, and configuaration. The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations."

This notebook is adapted from Jeremy Howard's fastai ML course. Some of the fastai dependencies are removed for performance comparisons and some of the fastai library functions are included here to make the notebook more self-contained. Such functions are attributed.
